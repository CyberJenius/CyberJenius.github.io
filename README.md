This project is a personal website for me. 
It will discuss my experiences, who I am, a bit about what I am interested and like to do and may possibly include a blog.
My ultimate goals for this project surround getting a bit more hands on experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while also giving me something fun and interesting to work on.
