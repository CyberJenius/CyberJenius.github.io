        <p class = blog-intro>This blog page will contain small articles explaining my thoughts on certain issues. I will also have a few posts 
          that work to explain some cool/useful things I learned when woring on a specific project. These writings will often be short and I hope 
          that they allow for some people to start their learning about specific issues, get them interested in something, or maybe even teach them
          something new.
