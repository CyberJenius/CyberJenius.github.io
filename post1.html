          In creating this website I learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and the inner workings of Github. In general throughout this project, 
          most of the bugs and errors I have run into were due to my limited knowledge of HTML and HTML best practices, or my limited knowledge 
          of CSS, both of which I have attempted to learn while working on this project. I began this project super excited to learn and make these
          two languages that I had little knowledge of in the past work together. As I got further into the project, my interest fizzled but I
          continued to work on it a bit almost every day. I was getting ahead of myself and am interested and excited to make new more interesting
          projects that have significantly more functionality on the backend. I'm still extremely happy with the final project however and hope others
          enjoy it too.

          I began this project by creating a github account. I knew that I wanted to begin side projects and beleived that having a github to make 
          these available and accessible to others to show my work was probably a good idea. I began not understanding it at first but slowly began to
          understand when to commit my code and what it meant to do so. While I did not use them for the project, I also got a decent understanding of 
          githubs ability to create pull requests, branch projects, and bring up issues with developers of open source software.
        </p>

          When I started this project I had some overview of HTML from a web development javascript class. This class was more focused on how to write 
          the backend javascript code however, and my projects were all pretty bland and layed out in pretty default HTML with no CSS. This lead me to learn
          ton about HTML as I did not understand many of the different structures like how to use boxes when looking at a design and using dividers and 
          elements within those dividers to reach the design you are looking for. 
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS in this project was brand new to me and I was extremely surprised with how much fun I had messing around with it. While most of the buttons,
          layouts, and ideas on my website are pretty simple, I found them very fun to make, design, and play around with. I tested my designs and ideas by 
          asking some friends what they thought and I ultimately came to the conclusion that most of the time in web design, simplicity can go a very long way.
