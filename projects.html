  <p class="title"> Projects </p>
  <p class="intro-text"> This page contains information about some of the projects that I have complete. The most recent projects will be at the top of the page and the less 
    recent projects will be at the bottom. I will be including both larger and smaller projects that I have completed in order to show growth, interest, and any expereince. 
    I will talk about most of these projects a bit more in depth in my blog page.

    <p> This Website! </p>
    <p> This project allowed for me to get more experience with web development and design. This project was mostly CSS and HTML with a very small amount of javascript for effects.
    In general, this project was a lot of fun for me to do. Most of my learning for this project surrounded CSS however, I learned a lot more about HTML elements and features
    as well. I had a lot of fun changing CSS and HTML properties and visually seeing the changes. Working to fit a design in my head was difficult but it was extremely rewarding
    whenever I would get a page designed, programmed, and working in a way I liked. I also created a github account and this is my first project in which I used git for version
    control. This was an extremely interesting expereince and going forward, I will be using github for all of my programming projects. It was fun to get a better grasp on version
    control, how it works, what it really is, and when to commit code changes. As someone who loves documentation, I greatly see the usefulness of this tool for comparisons, updates,
    and changes to any code.

    <p> School Related Projects! </p>
    <p> At the Pennsylvania State University, I did a number of different projects related to Cybersecurity, Programming, and Information Technology. These projects were often supplemented
    with some specific guidlines or help, and some also fell into the category of group projects. Due to the nature of these projects, and the fact they are directly related to Pennsylvania
    State Universities college of IST intellectual property, I cannot make these publicly available. More specifics on these projects can be discussed and/or inquired directly however, I
    sadly cannot directly provide the project files for review to remain the integrity of the PSU IST program. For future programming projects I will be using github, with most of my code 
    being publicly available there, and I will document/discuss future Cybersecurity based labs that I do through online training platforms with my "blog" page, and on this page as well.
