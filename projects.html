    <h1 class="title"> Projects </h1>
    <p class="intro-text"> This page contains information about some of the projects that I have complete. The most recent projects will be at the top of the page and the less 
      recent projects will be at the bottom. I will be including both larger and smaller projects that I have completed in order to show growth, interest, and any expereince. 
       will talk about most of these projects a bit more in depth in my blog page.

    <div class = windowsVM-div>
      <h1 class = windowsVM-title> Windows 11 Virtual Machine</h1>
      <p class = windowsVM-text> Recently, I created a virtualized computer running on Windows 11 OS using the open source UTM software for virtualization. This was a particularly cool
        project as I like the Windows 11 OS but have an Apple Laptop. I used UTM as I have a MacBook Air with an Apple M1 computing chip. These chips do not tend to work well with
        most common opensource vm software like virtualbox. It was a bit difficult to find a working Windows 11 .iso image but I eventually found one through an old forum and adding
        my email to a Microsoft email list. After I obtained this image I got the machine up and running on UTM in about 30 minutes. There were a few small errors that I had to 
        troubleshoot, like network settings not being shared correctly between my machine and the VM, but overall it was not too terrible and I now can run a windows machine on an
        Apple computer which is pretty cool.

    <div class = website-div>
      <h1 class = website-title> This Website </h1>
      <p class = website-text> This project allowed for me to get more experience with web development and design. This project was mostly CSS and HTML with a very small amount of javascript for effects.
        In general, this project was a lot of fun for me to do. Most of my learning for this project surrounded CSS however, I learned a lot more about HTML elements and features
        as well. I had a lot of fun changing CSS and HTML properties and visually seeing the changes. Working to fit a design in my head was difficult but it was extremely rewarding
        whenever I would get a page designed, programmed, and working in a way I liked. I also created a github account and this is my first project in which I used git for version
        control. This was an extremely interesting expereince and going forward, I will be using github for all of my programming projects. It was fun to get a better grasp on version
        control, how it works, what it really is, and when to commit code changes. As someone who loves documentation, I greatly see the usefulness of this tool for comparisons, updates,
        and changes to any code.

    <div class = school-div>
      <h1 class = school-title> School Related Projects </h1>
      <p class = school-text> At the Pennsylvania State University, I did a number of different projects related to Cybersecurity, Programming, and Information Technology. These projects were often supplemented
        with some specific guidlines or help, and some also fell into the category of group projects. Due to the nature of these projects, and the fact they are directly related to Pennsylvania
        State Universities college of IST intellectual property, I cannot make these publicly available. More specifics on these projects can be discussed and/or inquired directly however, I
        sadly cannot directly provide the project files for review to remain the integrity of the PSU IST program. For future programming projects I will be using github, with most of my code 
        being publicly available there, and I will document/discuss future Cybersecurity based labs that I do through online training platforms with my "blog" page, and on this page as well.
